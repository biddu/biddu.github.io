## Webinar 

We‚Äôre excited to launch The Circle, a new webinar series from the QUADRATURE project!


Why ‚ÄúThe Circle‚Äù?
Because it‚Äôs a place where people come together to share ideas and discuss, and a playful nod to the famous challenge of ‚Äúsquaring the circle,‚Äù directly tied to our project‚Äôs name.


The first event will feature:
+ üé§ Speaker: [Mathias Soeken](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mathias-soeken-90280a122/), Microsoft
+ üìå Title: Quantum System Architecture for Utility Scale
+ üóìÔ∏è Date & Time: 27 October 2025, 10:00 AM (CET)
+ üíª Where: Online via Microsoft Teams

  

üì© Register now and join us: [Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSef0KpVy6myGaNtmHdZUkVFr6KDBsdhm8FcvMxuF2VohHQiFw/viewform)



This is a unique opportunity to hear insights on how to scale quantum systems towards real-world utility. Don‚Äôt miss the chance to be part of the conversation ‚Äî the more we bring into the Circle, the better!
